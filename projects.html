                Here are some projects I have worked on so far during my college career. 
                I will be adding more as I finish up more programs in and outside of my classes.

                            This was my first programming course, where I learned the basics of the Java programming
                            language, putting those
                            skills to the test in various assignments and projects, which I placed into one website to
                            display for everyone.

                            This course I learned the basics of various programming languages like Racket,
                            Prolog and Haskell, which
                            I used in various assignments and problem sets,
                            which I placed into a website to display for everyone.

                            During my ISC325 course, I was tasked with creating a website using HTML
                            and CSS
                            about one of my favorite things. I decided to make a website about the game Faster than
                            Light(FTL), where I used
                            what I learned in class and online about HTML and CSS.

                            During my ISC325 course, I was assigned to a group to create a virtual
                            gallery about any topic.
                            My group decided to do a gallery based on finding any differences/similarites between space
                            in video games and anime, and history.
                            I was tasked with creating most of the website during this project, building the basic HTML
                            and CSS files for the website, that would be tied with
                            a discord bot the other team members were building.

                        on a semester long project, we learned about the software development cycle and used 
                        it to help design and implement our project which was a Virtual Escape Room.
