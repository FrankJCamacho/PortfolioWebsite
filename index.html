                at the end of Spring 2023. Currently, I have a GPA of 3.04 overall. During my classes here, I have become proficent in using languages
                such as Java, Javascript, HTML, CSS, Prolog, Racket and SQL. In my time outside of school, I have taken the

                Along with that, I have learned about the software development cycle, 
                how to use the various programs of Microsoft Office, become used to using programs like Git and Unix, 
                and have become proficent in using programs like 
                IntelliJ, Visual Studio Code, Unity, and MySQL Workbench. I'm also accustomed to using the Windows and Linux
                operating systems.
